Data Science Portfolio

This repository is where I keep a mix of my general data science work — everything from practice notebooks and small experiments to exploratory analysis, statistics, modeling, and automation scripts. It’s basically a running log of the things I’ve been learning, testing, or building outside of larger standalone projects.

My goal with this repo is to show how I approach problems, think through data, and continue improving my technical skills. You’ll find work involving Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Prophet, ARIMA, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, probability distributions, and other common tools and techniques I use day-to-day.

Larger or more polished projects will live in their own separate repositories. This space is just for everything else I want to document and look back on over time.
