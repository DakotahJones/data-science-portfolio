# data-science-portfolio
This repository is where I keep a mix of my general data science work, everything from practice notebooks and small experiments to exploratory analysis, statistics, modeling, and automation scripts. It’s basically a running log of the things I’ve been learning, testing, or building outside of larger standalone projects.
